If anybody would like to take this code and expand on the concept, feel free to do so, I just wanted to post it here incase something happens to the local copy, and a reminder of how far I have come.

S.O.P.H.I.A: An AI Chatbot
Welcome to S.O.P.H.I.A (Sentient Online Program with Human Interaction Awareness)! This is an AI-powered chatbot that I developed when I was 13 years old, 2020, as an early exploration into artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and emotional awareness in programs.

üåü Features
Natural Language Understanding: Responds to a wide range of phrases, questions, and conversation prompts.
Emotionally Aware Responses: The chatbot adjusts its tone based on user interactions, recognizing positive and negative emotions.
Fun Facts & Tips: Provides facts and helpful tips about various topics, including history, science, programming, psychology, and more.
Simple Magic 8-Ball Game: Users can ask yes/no questions, and the chatbot will give playful responses.
Basic Help & Guidance: Offers to assist the user and provides information or entertainment upon request.
Security Conscious: Built with an understanding of handling user inputs securely.
üéì What I Learned
Developing this chatbot was a significant milestone in my programming journey. Here‚Äôs what I learned:

Programming Fundamentals: Mastered core Python concepts, including conditional statements, loops, and handling user input.
Text Processing: Learned how to effectively analyze and respond to natural language input from users.
Time Management & Project Planning: Balancing schoolwork and developing a fun side project taught me valuable organizational skills.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used for the chatbot.
Colorama: Used to color the chatbot's text output, making interactions more engaging.
Random: Utilized for generating random responses (e.g., Magic 8-Ball game).
üöÄ How It Works
Greeting: The chatbot can recognize greetings and respond with a warm welcome.
Predefined Responses: If a user mentions certain keywords or phrases (e.g., "space fact," "programming tip," or "tell me a story"), S.O.P.H.I.A responds accordingly.
Emotion Handling: If a user is rude or insulting, the chatbot‚Äôs response changes to show sadness or disappointment. Conversely, compliments improve the chatbot's "happiness level."
Magic 8-Ball: Users can interact with a virtual Magic 8-Ball, which gives randomized, playful answers.
üí¨ Example Conversations
User: "Hi!"
S.O.P.H.I.A: "Hi there!!"

User: "Tell me a programming fact."
S.O.P.H.I.A: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!!"

User: "You're dumb."
S.O.P.H.I.A: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.."

User: "Give me a motivational quote."
S.O.P.H.I.A: "Within you lies the strength to conquer mountains and the wisdom to navigate seas. Embrace your journey, for every step forward is a testament to your incredible resilience and boundless potential. - S.O.P.H.I.A"

üåê Future Improvements
Advanced NLP: Integrating more sophisticated natural language processing libraries (like SpaCy or NLTK) for better understanding and response generation.
Emotion Tracking: Enhancing the emotional intelligence of the chatbot by integrating sentiment analysis to fine-tune responses.
Web Version: Creating a web-based interface for easier access and interaction.
üéØ Why This Project Is Important
This chatbot project represents my early interest in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Since developing this, I have gone on to create more complex and security-focused projects, but S.O.P.H.I.A remains a foundational step in my journey towards becoming a cybersecurity professional.
